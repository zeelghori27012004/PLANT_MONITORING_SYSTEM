A plant monitoring system provides growers with the ability to closely observe and control environmental factors, detect early signs of stress or disease, optimize resource usage, automate processes, make data-driven decisions and facilitate scientific research. By continuously monitoring plant health parameters and environmental conditions, such systems enhance plant care, increase productivity, conserve resources, enable remote management, and generate valuable insights for improved plant health and overall efficiency in various contexts, from agriculture and horticulture to scientific experimentation and home gardening.

The design contains plants enabled with the electronic component Arduino circuit with other electronic components like solar panel, sensors like DHT11, BH1750, JXCT NPK, MPU9250, solar cells, etc. This design helps in automation and remote management, data-driven decision making and resource efficiency.The sensors will detect the problem and send the signal to Arduino which will provide the solution of the problem. There will be water supply when water is required, if there is too much sunshine or wind speed then the shed will come out to protect the plant, etc. To provide voltage to all the electronics sources we also decided to use solar panels and cells so that the whole device is eco-friendly and does not harm the environment. By collecting and analyzing this data, growers can make data-driven decisions to optimize plant care strategies, develop predictive models, and improve overall plant health and productivity
